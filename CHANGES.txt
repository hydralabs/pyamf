versions of PyAMF.

.. contents::

0.4.2 (2009-04-20)
------------------
 - Support for decoding the 'source' property on ArrayCollections (Ticket:488)
 - Fixed an issue in the GAE adapter where dynamic properties would be missing
   on referenced objects. (Ticket:511)
 - Fixed a critical issue with AMF0 reference counting when encoding remoting
   responses. (Ticket:510)
 - Strengthened http header handling in the client (Ticket:492)
 - Support for Django i18n ugettext_lazy (Ticket:496)
 - Added support for microseconds for datetime objects. Thanks to Derek Payton
   for the patch. (Ticket:490)
 - Added support for property types on SQLAlchemy mapped classes. (Ticket:491)
 - Added support for property types for Google AppEngine db.Model and
   db.Expando. (Ticket:487)

0.4.1 (2009-02-23)
------------------
 - amf0.Encoder.use_amf3 has been extended to cover all object types
   (Ticket:453,467)
 - Property types on Django models will now encode as expected. (Ticket:480)
 - Django models.ForeignKey properties will be followed only if previously
   accessed outside of PyAMF. `_[attr]_cache` is no longer encoded.
   (Ticket:456)
 - Encoding {0:0, '0':1} will now raise an AttributeError. (Ticket:458)
 - Google AppEngine adapter improvements - see ticket for details (Ticket:479)
 - amf0.Encoder will encode all elements as AMF3 if use_amf3 option is set to
   True (Ticket:453)
 - Unicode handling in __repr__ functions has been improved (Ticket:455)
 - object attributes and dict keys are now utf8 encoded bytestrings. Python
   \**kwargs doesn't accept unicode key objects. (Ticket:463)
 - Django models.TimeField, models.DateField will now be converted to the
   correct type (datetime.time and datetime.date respectively).
   fields.NOT_PROVIDED is also checked for by converting to pyamf.Undefined
   and back again. (Ticket:457)

0.4 (2009-01-18)
----------------
 - cpyamf now deals with exceptional floats the same way as pure python -
   especially on windows (Ticket:448)
 - Support for SQLAlchemy 0.5.1 (Ticket:449)
 - amf0.Encoder now has a use_amf3 flag which determines which XML type to
   return to the client (Ticket:435)
 - BufferedByteString.truncate(length) now actually does something useful
   (Ticket:444)
 - setup.py now gets the version number from pyamf/__init__.py source
   (Ticket:429)

0.4rc3 (2009-01-14)
-------------------
 - Support for SQLAlchemy 0.5.0 (Ticket:436)
 - pyamf.util.DataTypeMixIn/cpyamf.util.BufferedByteStream can now
   encode/decode 24bit un/signed integers. (Ticket:422)
 - pyamf.util.StringIOProxy/cpyamf.util.BufferedByteStream both have new
   consume methods that will chop of the tail of the stream (already read
   stream). (Ticket:423)
 - Now checking for all types of supported xml lib types for encoding, but
   will only use the first implementation for decoding (Ticket:426)
 - fpconst dependancy is now only required if the platform requires it
   (Ticket:356)
 - Decoding negative timestamps on certain platforms (namely Windows) are now
   supported (Ticket:390)

0.4rc2 (2009-01-05)
-------------------
 - Support for SQLAlchemy 0.4.0 (Ticket:410)

0.4rc1 (2008-12-31)
-------------------
 - Support for encoding/decoding SQLAlchemy ORM objects with a new adapter.
   Lots of people involved in this one, but special thanks to Dave Thompson
   and Michael Van Tellingen for making this happen. (Ticket:277)
 - All gateways now log exceptions when exceptions are raised during
   en/decoding. (Ticket:394)
 - Flex messaging now uses correct static attributes for encoding. Determining
   static/dynamic attributes on objects is now easier (Ticket:357)
 - Added use_proxy option to amf3 which will automagically convert ObjectProxy
   to dict and ArrayCollection to list on decoding, and vice versa on encode.
   Thanks to dthompso for the excellent patch (Ticket:355)
 - flex.ArrayCollection now subclasses list instead of dict as non-int keys
   are not allowed. IList interface has been implemented. (Ticket:349)
 - Encoding registered subclass of list that define the 'externalised'
   metadata will be encoded as an object.
 - Encoders how have a 'strict' mode. Not generally useful for the time being
   but will help with developments in the future. Type mapped functions now
   require a second 'encoder' attribute. (Ticket:378)
 - Added adapter to handle the decimal module and, if strict is set to False,
   silently converts a Decimal instance to a float (Ticket:376)
 - ClassAlias can now be subclassed and three new methods have been added:
   applyAttributes, createInstance, getAttributes all which help to provide
   fine control for object/instance manipulation (Ticket:348)
 - Added support for __slots__ (Ticket:347)
 - Fixed problem when decoding objects that map to GAE db.Model objects with
   required properties (Ticket:342)
 - ByteArray now does not throw an error when used in the Remoting framework
   (Ticket:379)
 - A new adapter that converts sets.ImmutableSet and sets.Set to tuples before
   encoding. (Ticket:280)
 - A revamped google app engine adapter that checks for the _key attribute in
   an aliased class and first loads the object from the datastore and then
   applies that properties in the object stream. (Ticket:307)
 - New helper function to make it easier to manually add adapters (Ticket:350)
 - Ability to disable the c extension with passing --disable-ext to setup.py
   (Ticket:381, 391)
 - Python C-extension for the pyamf.util.BufferedByteStream class. Originally
   contributed by Gerard Escalante (Ticket:225, 405)
 - New API to add headers such as cookies in pyamf.remoting.client
   (Ticket:337)
 - Now clearing the context between remoting requests (Ticket:309)
 - Fixed issue with AMF3 class definition references (Ticket:341)
 - More helpful description for register_class args check (Ticket:334)
 - pyamf.register_class now checks to ensure that __init__ args do not have
   any arguments (Ticket:322)
 - Added RemoteObject support for AsyncMessage (Ticket:292)
 - pyamf.remoting.ErrorFault.__repr__ now displays the traceback info (if it
   exists). (Ticket:331)
 - Both Encoders will now raise pyamf.EncodeError if a function is encoded
   (Ticket:311)
 - Twisted Gateway would fall over when returning tuples (Ticket:313)
 - The remoting gateways now send a customizable Server header (Ticket:317)
 - The remoting client now sends a customizable User-Agent header (Ticket:306)
 - Added ability to set the HTTP referer in remoting client (Ticket:316)
 - Fixed issue where the AMF3 encoder assumed objects with a 'tag' attribute
   needed XML encoding. Reported by cy-man (Ticket:303)
 - Solved issue with repr for AbstractMessage. Reported by datafunk
   (Ticket:283)
 - Content-type was missing in POST requests from the AMF client. Reported by
   magog (Ticket:304)
