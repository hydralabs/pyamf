Maintainers
===========

The following people have commit access to the Subversion sources.
Note that this is not a full list of PyAMF's authors, however --
for that, you'd need to look over the log messages to see all the
patch contributors.

If you have a question or comment, it's probably best to mail
users@pyamf.org, rather than mailing any of these people
directly.
