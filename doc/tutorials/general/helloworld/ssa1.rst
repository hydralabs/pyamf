What is Server-side ActionScript
================================

Server-side |ActionScript (TM)| is based on the ECMA-262 specification

Client-side |ActionScript (TM)| is based on the ECMA-262 specification
but deviates from the specification in several places. Server-side
|ActionScript (TM)| does not deviate from the ECMA-262 specification.
